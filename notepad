i'm starting a machine learning course on coursera. this is like the third time i've started up, every time i quit midway. hopefully i dont quit

implemented better graphics, functions such as mathematical loops and effects into unlimited-bullets-festival

got touhou soundtrack: its better with all the bullet noises

	coursera machine learning notes:

		linear regression: finding the line that fits all the points

		functions at http://puu.sh/h90JM/a14f7baef7.png.

		cost function is the 1/2m thing

		m = number of training examples

		in the loop: i is the current training example

		h.theta(x(i)) is the same as theta.0 + theta.1*x(i).
		theta.1 is the slope, and x(i) is just the current x.

		The cost function: the average of the hypothesis(base and slope) differnce between the actual numbers.
		we are trying to make the cost function as low as possible.


	ideas for fixing up skyflower: make it more bullet-helly. minibosses that spam bullets everywhere, make the player hitbox smaller, add turrets that spray patterns everywhere, fix up the bosses to have more interesting patterns.

	stanford course:
		set: just a bunch of stuff in some kind of order, no duplicates
		hashset: no order
		lexicon
		map
